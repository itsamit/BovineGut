The community modelling code integrates individual models into paiwise community models.

All the individual models are given in the Individual\_GEMs directory.

The script for GCMs\_Reconstruction code has been provided as GCMs\_Reconstruction.ipynb.

The Out Community model will be generated in the Pairwise\_GCMs directory.
The FBA data will be generated in the FBA directory.

The FVA data will be generated in the FVA directory.
